Barbara Hepworth was an artist who was born more than a hundred years ago, in 1903.
<br><br>
She is best known for making sculptures with holes in them. A sculpture is like a statue, except that it is made by an artist.
<br><br>
Barbara Hepworth did not make sculptures of people or animals. She instead made sculptures of shapes that she thought were interesting. Artists have a name for things they make that do not look like real things - they are called abstract forms. Here is a picture of one of Barbara Hepworth's abstract forms:

She was born in Wakefield, which is a town in Yorkshire. When she was 18 she studied at the Royal College of Art, which is a University in London. 99 years ago it was not usual for women to do this.
<br><br>
When she was 21 she travelled to Italy. While she was there she learnt how to sculpt marble.  It was around this time that she became well known and she started winning pizes for her art.
<br><br>
It was later, when she was 28, that she became known for making sculptures with holes in them. Nowadays, when most people who think they know a thing or two about art see a sculpture with a hole in it they will think of another sculptor called Henry Moore.
Henry Moore has become more well know for these kinds of sculptures than Barbara Hepworth, but the truth is that he copied the idea from Barbara. She did the whole hole thing first!
<br><br>
When she was 26 she had a son called Paul, and at 31 she gave birth to triplets, Rachel, Sarah, and Simon.
<br><br>
During the war she left London and moved to Cornwall. Eventually she settled in a small Cornish town called St. Ives.
<br>
<br>
In 1953 her son, Paul, was killed in a plane crash. He was 24 years old when he died. 
<br>
<br>
Between 1954 and 1956 she made a lot of sculptures out of wood. Here is one of them - this piece was inspired by what she saw and did when she visited the country Greece, in 1954.

<br><br>
This sculpture was made out of a piece of wood that came from a tree trunk that a friend gave to her as a gift. The trunk weighed 17 tons, which is about as heavy as 10 cars!
<br><br>
In the mid to late 1950s her work became better known in America.
<br><br>
In 1965 she was made a Dame by the Queen.
<br><br>
Here is a picture of her sculpting wood.

When she was 72 she died in an accidental fire that was cause by one of her cigarettes.
